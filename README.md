# Optimizing Vehicle Routes: A Solution to the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows

Efficient logistics and transportation are critical challenges faced by businesses in industries such as retail, e-commerce, and supply chain management. The Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows (CVRPTW) is a classic combinatorial optimization problem that models real-world scenarios where a fleet of vehicles must deliver goods to customers while minimizing operational costs. Each vehicle operates under capacity constraints, and customers must be served within predefined time windows, adding complexity to the problem.

With the rapid growth of e-commerce and just-in-time delivery services, solving CVRPTW effectively has become increasingly important to reduce transportation costs, minimize environmental impact, and improve customer satisfaction. However, finding optimal solutions is computationally challenging due to the large solution space and multiple constraints.

This project focuses on addressing one main question:

1. How can we design efficient vehicle routes to minimize total travel distance while meeting capacity and time window constraints?

By tackling this question, this project aims to provide insights into solving real-world logistics problems using efficient heuristic methods and to identify areas for further improvement or exploration in routing optimization.
